    <h1>Art Culture</h1>
      <p>The ever-growing Chicago art scence is fun, inviting and diverse and often times <strong>free</strong> to residents. There's an array of galleries, exhibits, standing sculputres, performance art shows,local venues, and even community art-walks.</p>
      <p> I've had the opputunity to visit many different art events of all kinds, contemporary to graffiti events and there's so much artist diversity in Chicago I truly believe that there is something here for everyone to love and be inspired by when checking out Chicago's art culture.</p>    
       <h2>The Musuem of Contemporary Art Chicago</h2>
         <p>-Also known as MCA Chicago</p>
        <p>MCA Chicago is a contemporary art musuem located in  220 E Chicago Ave, in the downtown Chicago area. This musuem is gallery-style, Which I really enjoy it makes your experience more personal and you forget that your in a local musuem. This is a beautiful facility, with great architure and design. Itshard not to be creativily inspired when visting MCA Chicago.</p>
